# Data Architecture Assignment 2 - Cross Module Time Series Data

This CA is designed to showcase and integrate your work in Data
Architecture during Semester 2. It is a joint project with Time Series
Analysis. You will be using the same dataset for both.

## Deliverables

Supply a single ZIP file `ca2.zip` (not .rar) with the necessary files
included. File names are case-sensitive. Where multiple formats are
accepted, the first matching will be taken and others ignored.

Your submission must have a `README.txt` file with your student number
and name in it. If any specific notes regarding setup are required,
place them in `README.txt`. It will otherwise be assumed that any `sql`
files are for PostgreSQL, `py` files are for Python3.8 as on the shared
server and `.sh` files are for bash on Amazon Linux on the shared
server.
