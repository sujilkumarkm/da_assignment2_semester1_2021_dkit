**************************************************************************************************************
3 changes I would make to the technical or organisational aspects of this project if I'm completing it again.
**************************************************************************************************************

1. I would use dynamically updated database for collecting measurements time to time. Probably use some web framework like Laravel for facilitate company admins to update the record time to time.

2. In Data Archtecture I would be including forecast using python or sql, It would add valuw to my extertise in SQL and python. Further research is required to accomblish this task.

3. In the future, I would like run evaluation techiques in sql to see the error and accuracy of the model.
